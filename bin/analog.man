.SH NAME
analog \- analyse a apache log file 
.SH SYNOPSIS
analog [-t HH:MM] [ -g dot_file ] [-e] log_file.log
.SH DESCRIPTION
analog is a C++ application that allows you to analyse a apache log file. 
The program always displays the top 10 of the most fetched targets in addition to the other functionalities specified by the options. 
 The following options are available :



-g : Generates a graph of navigation from the log file. This option takes as a compulsory argument a file name. The program will create a dot file with this file name. This created file will contain the graph of navigation. If the file already exits its content is going to be replaced by that of the new graph.


-t : This option is to be used in conjunction with the option -g.
It takes as a compulsory argument an hour of the form 'HH:MM'
The graph generated represents requests that were made within one hour of the given time. 


-e : This option is to be used in conjunction with the option -g.
The graph is generated without taking into account the targets that are javascript files or images files or
css files.
.SH EXEMPLES
analog log_file.log -- Top 10 fetched targets only.


analog -g dot_file file_log.log -- Creates or updates dot_file.dot, generates a graph of navigation into the dot file. Then it displays the top 10 targets.


analog -g dot_file -t HH:MM file_log.log -- same as previous exemple but focused on the specified time. Then it displays the top 10 targets.
